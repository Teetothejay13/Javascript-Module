        <p class = "three-d-intro-paragraph">Here, you’ll find more complex origami projects. These ones tend to be harder than anything else posted, and they will often take far 
          longer to complete. Only take on these projects if you have some experience in paper folding, as well as plenty of time on your hands. In order to make many of these 
          projects, you will need to know how to make the basic pieces. Visit this tutorial to learn how: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZAuKJmkxj44">https://youtu.be/ZAuKJmkxj44</a></p>
        
        <h2 class = "three-d-entry-header-1">Miraculous Ladybug and Cat Noir</h2>
        <p class = "three-d-entry-paragraph-1">These models are characters in the popular french cartoon Miraculous Ladybug and Cat Noir. They take about 140 pieces each and a few hours to make, 
          not including the facial details. I designed and folded the models for a relative who is a fan of the show, so there is no tutorial for these models.</p>

        <h2 class = "three-d-entry-header-2">Large Swan</h2>
        <p class = "three-d-entry-paragraph-2">This project is one of the biggest I’ve completed. It took over 1500 pieces, and nearly a month of folding to make. I only had a little 
          time each day, but if you have more time on your hands then you could make this in a shorter time period. One note I’d like to make is that the tutorial won’t get you this 
          exact result, seeing as I took some creative liberties when making it. The tutorial will only give you a similar product.<br><br>Tutorial: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC9Xgcy3acI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC9Xgcy3acI</a></p>

        <h2 class = "three-d-entry-header-3">Spiderman</h2>
        <p class = "three-d-entry-paragraph-3">This model is of Marvel's famous character Spiderman. It took around 130 pieces and a couple hours of my time to make, not including facial details.
        The spider logo on the chest was rather hard to cut out, but I was able to manage it with an exacto knife. I designed and folded this model myself, so there is no tutorial for this model.
        However, there are tutorials to make similar models on youtube.</p>
