# Overview

This software is an extention of software I had already written some time ago. Back then, I had just written HTML, CSS, and minimal Javascript to simply create a display of my origami creations, of which I had many from my years of having it as my hobby. With the new code added this time around, I made a proof of concept, to show what it would look like if others submitted their projects and I chose to display them on my website at the click of a button.

Originally, I had created it just to show off my hobby. However, as I was reviewing old projects, I thought it would be a neat learning experience to take that old HTML and CSS and throw in some competent Javascript to make it a little more interactable. My ultimate goal for this website was to create something to show off my creations, and also accept submissions from other people to display their work as well. However, I do not have it hosted nor do I have a backend set up yet, so for now I wanted to make a mock-up of what it would look like, which is where the Javascript came in.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code to work on this project, and simply used the live server extention to see the changes as I made them.

Since this is a web app, I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript, with the main focus being Javascript. I wanted to focus on Javascript for this learning experience, so other than populating the new content, I tried to leave the pre-existing HTML and CSS alone.
